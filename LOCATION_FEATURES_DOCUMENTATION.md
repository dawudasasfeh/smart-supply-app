- `permission_handler: ^11.3.1` - Permission management

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Google Maps API Key
You need to obtain a Google Maps API key and add it to the Android manifest:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
           android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
```

### 2. Permissions
Location permissions are automatically configured for both Android and iOS.

## Usage

### For Users:
1. **Automatic Detection**: Tap the location icon (üìç) next to the address field
2. **Map Selection**: Tap the map icon (üó∫Ô∏è) to open the full-screen map picker
3. **Manual Entry**: Type an address directly in the text field

### For Developers:
The location data is automatically included in the signup profile data:
```dart
{
  'address': 'User entered address',
  'latitude': 31.2001,
  'longitude': 29.9187
}
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Location services disabled
- Permission denied
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid addresses
- Timeout errors

All errors are displayed as user-friendly messages with appropriate action suggestions.

## Testing

To test the location features:
1. Run the app on a physical device (location services don't work well in emulators)
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Test both automatic detection and map selection
4. Verify that coordinates are properly stored in the backend

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Location history for frequently used addresses
- Address autocomplete/suggestions
- Offline map support
- Location-based business recommendations
- Delivery radius validation
